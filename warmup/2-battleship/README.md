# Battleship

| #warmup | Time limit: 5s

You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with $R$ rows and $C$ columns.
There are 0 or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell.
The cell in the $i^{th}$ row from the top and $j^{th}$ column from the left either contains a battleship ($G_{i,j} = 1$) or doesn't ($G_{i,j} = 0$).

You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid.
You'll choose this cell uniformly at random from the $Râˆ—C$ possible cells.
You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship.

Your task is to implement the function `getHitProbability(R, C, G)` which returns this probability.

Note: Your return value must have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$ to be considered correct.

## Constraints

$1 \geq R, C \geq 100$
$0 \geq G_{i, j} \geq 1$

## Sample test case #1

```
R = 2
C = 3
G = 0 0 1
    1 0 1

Expected Return Value = 0.50000000
```

## Sample test case #2

```
R = 2
C = 2
G = 1 1
    1 1

Expected Return Value = 1.00000000
```
